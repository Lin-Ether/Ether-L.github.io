Oxford has more than 30 colleges which provide courses for undergraduate students. Hence, choosing a college can be a tough question. <!--more-->Here I'm going to introduce some ways to help you choose your college.

### Admit Rate

Oxford has published tables on [College Success Rates](https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityofOxford-CollegeSuccessRates2019/CollegeSuccessRates?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&:showTabs=y&:showVizHome=no) and [Applications by College](https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityofOxford-AdmissionsStatistics2019ByCollege/ApplicationsbyCollege?%3Aembed=y&%3Adisplay_count=yes&%3AshowTabs=y&%3AshowVizHome=no) which can be useful for you to choose your college. For example, if you want to know whether a college has a preference towards state school students, just check the Admissions Statistics and select "School Type" as column demographics.

### Teaching Faculty

It is important for you to check the official website of the institute of your own course and search for the teaching faculty of your targeted colleges. The research interests of each member are listed on the website and if they share the same interests with you, it can serve as a good reason for you to choose this college.

### Norrington Table

[Norrington Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norrington_Table) is also another good resource which gives a general ranking of the Oxford colleges each year. However, since the factors are quite fixed, there is no need to rely too much on it.

### Whatdotheyknow

[Whatdotheyknow](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/) is a website where you can make requests for the data from authorities. Hence, a lot of requests for Oxford admission statistics were made in the past. This may include some helpful data such as the average MAT score of offer holders in each college. These requests are archived and you can access to them by searching "University of Oxford" then key words. Also, you can make your own request if you cannot find the statistics you want. 

If you fail to load this website, you can download a VPN and locate yourself in a place other than Hong Kong.

### Political Scale
