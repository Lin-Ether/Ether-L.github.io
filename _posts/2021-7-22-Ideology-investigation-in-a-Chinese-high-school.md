It is evident that citizens in China are experiencing a vacillating change in ideologies. The conflicts between the rising leftists and the steadfast conservatives are now exacerbating with no one able to evade. <!--more-->In this very moment, an ideology investigation is indispensable and the high school students, whose minds are the most active and susceptible, become the subject of this investigation.

### Preceding Investigations

This investigation is mostly inspired by [a former one published on zhihu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/388963587) whose report can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/file/某高中意识形态调查报告（完整版）.pdf). It was conducted in a first-tier high school in Shanghai, the result of which, accordingly, might be hard to generalise. Hence, this investigation aims to duplicate the former one on a revised scale in a second-tier city high school in order to test its reliability.

### Questionnaire Design

Since the preceding questionnaire was based on the [8values test](https://8values.github.io/), this investigation also adopts 8values test with a few changes made to it. These include some additions in background investigation, several rephrasings in the translation and 6 new questions, mostly selected from other political test websites, attached to the end of the questionnaire with no impact to the final algorithm.
