It is evident that citizens in China are experiencing a vacillating change in ideologies. The conflicts between the rising leftists and the steadfast conservatives are now exacerbating with no one able to evade. <!--more-->At this very moment, an ideology investigation is indispensable and the high school students, whose minds are the most active and susceptible, become the subject of this investigation.

### Preceding Investigations

This investigation is mostly inspired by [a former one published on ZhiHu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/388963587) whose report can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/file/某高中意识形态调查报告（完整版）.pdf). It was conducted in a first-tier high school in Shanghai, the result of which, accordingly, might be hard to generalize. Hence, this investigation aims to duplicate the former one on a revised scale in a second-tier city high school in order to test its reliability.

### Questionnaire Design

Since the preceding questionnaire was based on the [8values test](https://8values.github.io/), this investigation also adopts 8values test with a few changes made to it. These include some additions in the background investigation, a little rephrasing in the translation and 6 new questions, mostly selected from other political test websites, attached to the end of the questionnaire with no impact to the final algorithm. In the formal part of the questionnaire, each question is followed by 6 options, namely "Strongly Disagree", "Disagree", "Neutral", "Agree", "Strongly Agree" and "Unsure/Cannot understand".

### Sample

The participants of this investigation were from a public high school in Zhejiang Province, China. Most students lived on campus and went back home once a week. This school was renowned for its excellent academic performance, with around 90% students going to the first tier universities each year. All the students had studied the compulsory part of high school politics and sat the Academic Proficiency Test, some of which had taken politics as the optional subject. The school rarely offered optional courses related to politics or economics and mobile phones were not allowed within the campus implying that students had limited ways of obtaining information while staying at school. Also, it is worth noting that the place where the school located has a thriving culture of Christianity compared with many other places in China.

### Pretest

16 volunteers, including 4 team members, were engaged in the pretest. 15 of them returned valid questionnaires. After the pretest, one of the question was rephrased due to its vagueness. The result was published on a GitHub Page.

### Posttest

The questionnaire was published on social medias (eg. WeChat, QQ) and 140 participants responded. 132 of them were considered as valid. In order to guarantee the validity of the survey, the result was published by searching the No. given right after the test.
